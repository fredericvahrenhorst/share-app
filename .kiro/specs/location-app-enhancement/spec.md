# ShareApp - Location-based Resource Sharing Application

## Overview

The ShareApp is a sustainable resource sharing application built as a Turborepo monorepo with Payload CMS backend and Ionic Vue frontend. The app enables users to discover and share free resources in their community through an interactive map interface, focusing on sustainability, community sharing, and resource accessibility.

## Core Concept

**Map-first UX**: Users primarily interact through an interactive map to find resources like:
- ðŸ§Š Food sharing fridges
- ðŸ‘• Free clothing exchanges  
- ðŸ’§ Water sources
- ðŸŒ± Other community resources

- **Maps**: Mapbox GL JS with custom markers and clustering
- **Animations**: VueUse/GSAP for micro-animations
- **Offline**: IndexedDB caching

### Backend
- **CMS**: Payload CMS 3.46.0
- **Framework**: Next.js 15
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
