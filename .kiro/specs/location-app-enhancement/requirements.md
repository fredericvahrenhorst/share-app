# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the ShareApp - a sustainable resource sharing application. The ShareApp is designed to help users discover and share free resources in their community through an interactive map interface. The application is built as a Turborepo monorepo with a Payload CMS backend and an Ionic Vue frontend, focusing on sustainability, community sharing, and resource accessibility. The core concept is "map-first UX" where users primarily interact through an interactive map to find resources like food sharing fridges, free clothing, water sources, and other community resources. The app uses Leaflet.js or Mapbox for mapping with custom marker icons and clustering, includes micro-animations with VueUse/GSAP, and provides offline support through IndexedDB caching.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to discover free resources through an interactive map interface, so that I can easily find sustainable sharing opportunities in my area.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the map loads THEN the system SHALL display clustered markers with zoom-level-dependent detailing
2. WHEN a user applies resource type filters (Food, Kleidung, Wasser, etc.) THEN the system SHALL show only matching resource locations
3. WHEN a user searches by city, PLZ, or address THEN the system SHALL provide auto-complete suggestions and center the map accordingly
4. WHEN markers are displayed THEN the system SHALL use color-coded and iconographic representation based on resource type
5. IF a user's location is available THEN the system SHALL show distance information and sort nearby resources by proximity
6. WHEN a user sets a radius filter THEN the system SHALL display only resources within the specified distance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detailed resource information in an intuitive interface, so that I can understand how to use shared resources responsibly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps a map marker THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip with resource type, opening hours, distance, and status
2. WHEN a user selects "Details anzeigen" THEN the system SHALL open a bottom sheet/modal with comprehensive resource information
3. WHEN resource details are displayed THEN the system SHALL show images, description, address, opening hours, and usage rules
4. WHEN usage rules exist THEN the system SHALL prominently display guidelines (e.g., "bitte kein Fleisch reinlegen")
5. IF the resource has special tags THEN the system SHALL display badges like "24/7", "Ã¶ffentlich", "von Privatperson"
6. WHEN a user wants navigation THEN the system SHALL provide "Route Ã¶ffnen in Maps" functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a community member, I want to contribute new resource locations and interact with existing ones, so that I can help build a comprehensive sharing network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps the floating action button THEN the system SHALL start a step-by-step resource addition flow
2. WHEN adding a resource THEN the system SHALL provide map-picker, category selection, description input, and optional image upload
3. WHEN a user saves a resource as favorite THEN the system SHALL add it to their personal favorites list
4. WHEN logged-in users view resources THEN the system SHALL allow star ratings, comments, and upvoting
5. IF a user wants to report issues THEN the system SHALL provide "Standort melden" functionality
6. WHEN a resource is successfully added THEN the system SHALL show a success animation (e.g., growing plant)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse resource categories intuitively, so that I can discover different types of sharing opportunities available in my community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses category overview THEN the system SHALL display a grid with icons and short descriptions
2. WHEN categories are shown THEN the system SHALL include examples like "ðŸ§Š Foodsharing KÃ¼hlschrank â€“ Lebensmittel retten"
3. WHEN a user selects a category THEN the system SHALL filter the map to show only that resource type
4. WHEN location services are available THEN the system SHALL show "Beliebte in deiner NÃ¤he" suggestions
5. IF accessibility filters are applied THEN the system SHALL show only barrier-free resources
6. WHEN users navigate categories THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions with micro-animations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a new user, I want a smooth onboarding experience, so that I understand how to use the app effectively while feeling confident about my privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first opens the app THEN the system SHALL provide a maximum 3-screen animated onboarding flow
2. WHEN onboarding is displayed THEN the system SHALL focus on data privacy and app benefits
3. WHEN location permission is needed THEN the system SHALL request it only when necessary with clear explanation
4. WHEN users need guidance THEN the system SHALL provide explanation animations and tooltips like "So funktioniert die Karte"
5. IF users complete onboarding THEN the system SHALL remember their preferences for future sessions
6. WHEN critical features are introduced THEN the system SHALL use contextual help and smooth micro-animations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a community member, I want to engage with other users and build reputation, so that I can contribute to a trustworthy sharing ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users create accounts THEN the system SHALL provide user profiles with favorites and shared resources
2. WHEN users interact with resources THEN the system SHALL allow commenting and community feedback
3. WHEN inappropriate content appears THEN the system SHALL provide "Beitrag melden" functionality with moderation
4. WHEN users contribute actively THEN the system SHALL award badges for community engagement
5. IF users share resources THEN the system SHALL track and display their contribution history
6. WHEN building trust THEN the system SHALL implement community validation for new resource submissions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be maintainable and scalable, so that new features can be added efficiently and the system can handle growth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new features are developed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent code structure across frontend and backend
2. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN the system SHALL follow RESTful conventions and include proper error handling
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper indexing for performance optimization
4. WHEN user data is processed THEN the system SHALL comply with data protection and privacy requirements
5. IF system load increases THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling through proper architecture
6. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive test coverage for critical functionality
