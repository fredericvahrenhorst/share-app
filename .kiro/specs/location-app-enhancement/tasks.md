## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

- Start each task by writing tests where applicable
- Use TypeScript strictly throughout the codebase
- Follow Airbnb ESLint config with single quotes
- Implement responsive design mobile-first
- Use Tailwind CSS custom classes for reusable styles

### Code Organization

- Components in `/src/components/` with PascalCase naming
- Pinia stores in `/src/stores/` with camelCase + "Store" suffix
- Composables in `/src/composables/` for reusable logic
- Types in `/packages/shared/` for cross-app usage

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual components and functions
- Integration tests for store interactions and API calls
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Visual regression tests for design consistency

### Performance Targets

- First Contentful Paint < 2s
- Largest Contentful Paint < 3s
- Map interaction response < 100ms
- Offline functionality for core features
